# Homework 1
## Task Overview
Create a program for analyzing an audio signal in the time and frequency domains.
The program should accept a short audio file (.wav) and allow visualization of graphs for the required analyses. 
For input purposes, record or find an audio file about 5 seconds long (preferably speech).
## Subtasks
1. Time Domain Analysis
- Amplitude analysis
- Marking the start and end of a sound
- Zero-Crossing Rate
2. Frequency Domain Analysis
- Spectrogram display
- Finding fundamental frequency
  
# Homework 2
## Task Overview
Write a program for recognizing spoken digits 0â€“9 in the Serbian language.
The program accepts and classifies an audio file containing a recording of a single word, displaying the recognized digit or informing the user that the audio does not contain a digit.

## Subtasks
- Implement the DTW (Dynamic Time Warping) algorithm for recognizing the digit in the input audio file.
- Compare DTW results using Mel Spectrogram, MFCC, and LPC features on the input file.
- Choose parameters arbitrarily and make a decision based on detection.
- Recognize when the submitted sound is not a digit.
- Algorithmically go through all student recordings and find the one whose pronunciation is closest to yours.
